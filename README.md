whatsapp text sender with c# and .net 5.0

//this is a whatsapp text sender that works with the help of twilio which is a messaging api
//this project is still unfinished and all it need are the finishing touches (exceptions handling)

to use the app all you have to do is to create a free account on https://www.twilio.com/
after you create your account get a free trial phone number from twilio and go to messaging/try it out/send a whatsapp message
set up your twilio sandbox by following the instructuions given there
after that you're all set up and ready to use the app
run the project as an administrator since it needs to create some new environment variables
enter the account sid, authentication token, your phone number, the twilio phone number (not the sms number, the number from the whatsapp section) and the message.
